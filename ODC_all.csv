There is no way to download the entire data set at once.  You can get some of it after a search though.   Regardless, this online data set does not include the data required in the description: 

""Top-level government officials’ financial assets, including: name of top-level government officials, title, investment information, prior and current business relationships, real estate interests, and personal income (including gifts and travel or speaking payments).""

----

If it doesn't contain the data in the census description, how can it be said that this data is available online? Shouldn't the first question of ""Does the data exist?"" be ""Unsure""?  Thought to be fair, Anchorage's data here seems to be closer to any other US city in terms of lining up with the census requirements.

","--- **Note about method for evaluation:** When responding to the questions I leveraged the Florida Department of Law Enforcement website for the county (DUVAL) in answering the questions as it's an official govt source and should include the beaches areas (not included in JSO)  of the City of Jacksonville. However, in a response from ""CindyDurrett@fdle.state.fl.us"" on 10/13/2016 they don't receive data from local agencies at that level of detail and also confirmed that the data is ""Open to the Public"" but must cite them as the source. I marked openly licensed as unknown because it requires a URL if you mark yes. 

**Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO) portal for crime statistics and mapping**

http://www.coj.net/departments/sheriffs-office/crime-statistics.aspx

It's a great first stop offering details on data resources, consideration of crime statistics with other data compliments to help interpret and make valid assessments of crime. It also provides disclaimers on the data and 3rd party agency mapping tools. It even offers quick links by zone for view information for each area.

In terms of the data it seems there are 3 main areas:

**1. Mapping Tool**

http://www.coj.net/departments/sheriffs-office/crime-statistics-information-acceptance.aspx

This is the closest resource to granular date and location based crime incidents. JSO provides crime data to this 3rd party. The biggest thing that sticks out is the mention from JSO that ""This information is not intended to be used as official crime data. This program does not provide information about all reported crimes, and excludes specific incidents such as sexual assaults and child abuse."" As a result the mapping tool can not be used as it's not an official 3rd party representing JSO.

**2. FBI Uniform Crime Statistics Site**
 
http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/LocalCrimeLarge.cfm

-- upon review it appears you get SUMMARY statistics but not the raw data for the city of Jacksonville. There are limitations on the summary data but that is outside the scope of this exercise if it's not the raw data. 

**3. Florida Department of Law Enforcement Website**

https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/cms/FSAC/Data-Statistics-(1).aspx.

Upon further investigation this is a forth source for information that has a huge page of recently completed dispatched calls for service with some components of the preferred data fields for crime stats and is commingled with other crime data

Again this data has a disclaimer -> ""This information is not intended to be used as official crime data. This program does not provide information about all crimes, and excludes specific incidents such as sexual assaults and child abuse.""

Summary information from ->  http://www.floridahealth.gov/Environmental-Health/food-safety-and-sanitation/faq-page.html#faq_top1

1. Who regulates food operations?

Food Safety in Florida is regulated by multiple agencies. The main three are: the Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. Additionally, the following agencies regulate food services for some of their licensees: Department of Children and Families (child care facilities, child caring agencies, etc.), Agency for Health Care Administration (hospitals and nursing homes), Agency for Persons with Disabilities (group homes that support and provide services for persons with disabilities).

(i) Generally, the Department of Health regulates food service establishments located in institutional settings (such as schools, assisted living facilities, adult day cares, and detention facilities), civic and fraternal organizations, bars and lounges that don't prepare foods, and theaters that limit their food service to items customarily served at theaters (such as beverages, popcorn, hotdogs, and nachos).  For info, contact one of our local health departments or call (850) 245-4277.

(ii) The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services generally regulates whole-sale food operations, convenience stores, grocery stores, food processing operations, food storage/warehouse operation and non-alcoholic beverage operations (such as juice or smoothie bars and coffee houses). They can be reached by telephone at (850) 245-5520.

(iii) The Department of Business and Professional Regulation regulates restaurants, most mobile food vehicles, caterers, and most public food service events. You can reach their Customer Contact Center by calling (850) 487-1395 or you can file a complaint on line at

This is a supporting link covering the details of the file layout -> http://www.myfloridalicense.com/dbpr/sto/file_download/layout/public-records-hr.html 

I marked that it is not available in bulk because it’s a list of separate CSV files by fiscal year and district. 

Licensing of the data is strictly protected by a state of Florida copyright notice and prevents it from being commercially used -> http://www.myflorida.com/myflorida/copyright.html . The question is this still applicable on data that is public record? 

Data updated/provided on a timely basis? I answered yes because the data is documented as being updated weekly and was two days from the date at which I looked at this submission for the current fiscal year.

""We are making it easier than ever for residents to connect with City Hall and request municipal services,"" said Mayor Elorza. ""The 3-1-1 line and PVD311 mobile app are results of our efforts to make local government more open, accountable, and responsive. Whether you need to report a pothole or request trash pickup, I encourage residents to utilize these new tools.""

Residents can dial 3-1-1 from their landline or mobile phone to reach the Mayor's Center for City Services. Representatives will tend to non-emergency calls during business hours and residents will be able to leave a message during off-hours. Calls will be tracked 24 hours a day through a comprehensive database, which will allow the city to monitor the incoming flow and types of requests, and follow up with residents with updates.

The PVD311 mobile application is available to download now on iOS through the Apple App Store and for Android on Google Play. The app offers a simple user friendly interface and access to a range of city and state services. Residents will be able to create a personal profile, submit a variety of service requests, pay bills, view the latest in city schedules and news, and receive updates directly on their mobile device. Requests and reviews entered through the app will be public and viewable on an interactive map and shareable on social media.

In addition to the mobile app, the City of Providence also offers 24-hour online assistance at http://providenceri.com/pvd311","Yes","No","Ivan Monzon-Natareno","Ivan Monzon-Natareno","45"

Many cases have incomplete data (e.g. many have no addresses linked to the cases at all, not even a zip code). Many of the categories for filtering the data seem superfluous (e.g. ""Address Street Suffix""). The quality of the data also suffers from the lack of action by the city on many of these cases more generally. For example, only a very small fraction of the cases have been marked ""closed."" These makes analyzing the data impossible in that regard (e.g. by trying to figure out the average response time for a given case). Lastly, a better description of the ""case numbers"" would help; for example, who is/was responsible for a given case would add an important measure of transparency.

Arlington's GTFS hasn't been updated since 2013; not being intimately familiar with GTFS, I want to say this is ok, because as long as the routes haven't changed, neither has the GTFS.

1) Openly Licensed:
Many datasets (all from open data group ironically enough) Arlington County has up in their ArcGIS Open Data Portal, there's a disclaimer @ the bottom of the description on search listings pages, saying: 
""Data is not for resale or redistribution""
Clicking through to a datasets individual page, there's a larger disclaimer on the right hand column saying:  
""This group is to allow for downloading data via ESRI's Open Data application.  

Unless otherwise noted, all data is © Arlington County, Virginia.

The geographic data layers produced by the Arlington County GIS Mapping Center are provided as a public resource. The County makes no warranties,expressed or implied, concerning the accuracy, completeness or suitability of this data, and it should not be construed or used as a legal description. Every reasonable effort is made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data.  This data is not considered in the Public Domain.""

Not sure what is going on here, seems like Arlington is doing the open data thing, but not because they want to.
Pretty sure none of those copyrights/disclaimers are valid or will hold up in court.
It's just very odd.

The restaurant violations are not available in bulk, but instead have to be sifted through for each individual restaurant. The violations and the points scale are not explained well (if at all). Under the violations sections available data include Inspection Date, Inspection Type, Score (1-100), Grade (e.g. A, B, or C), and Violation Count.  

The facility details are also segregated by date, with those rated prior to July 1, 2013 (http://www.lapublichealth.org/rating/) and those rated afterward (here: https://ehservices.publichealth.lacounty.gov/ezsearch).

Contributions, expenditures, and committee to committee must be downloaded separately for each year.

Data is detailed, except that contributions are by committee.

Because of committee to committee donations, it can be difficult to track donations to specific issues and candidates that move across committees.

That chapter defines a landmark building or site as ""one of execptional importance to the city, state or nation and whose demolition would represent an irreparable loss to the city."" An historic building or site is defined as ""one that is close to a Landmark Building or Site in importance, but lacks some of the exceptional qualities of a Landmark.""

The document is a PDF plan. The data contained in them is not always tabular, and not always the same format, but more importantly embedded in huge blocks of text and other information. The detail is fairly deep, especially in the line item documents, and seems to be a complete data set, but it would take extensive manual work to put it into a machine readable format. The line item documents have the least amount of extraneous text and the most consistent format, so would be the best for extraction.  

The licensing is not specified at all, and should be even if public domain. The publication data is after the budget is enacted. Proposed budgets might be available in a more timely fashion, but this information is not available at this time because of the current budget cycle.

The *detail is fairly high*, with exact address and CAD call locations included.  
  
There is *no metadata* detailing the different fields. There is *no API*, as the format is CSV only. Summaries are in PDF format alongside the CSVs.  
  
One enormous structural weakness is that the CSVs are requested via POST form with an encrypted parameter. There is no way to get a permanent link to any given CSV, so the CSV files must be *manually downloaded and processed*.
